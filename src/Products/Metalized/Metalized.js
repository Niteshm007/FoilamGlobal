              <p>
                Metallised films (or metallized films) are polymer films coated
                with a thin layer of metal, usually aluminium. They offer the
                glossy metallic appearance of an aluminium foil at a reduced
                weight and cost. Metallised films are widely used for decorative
                purposes and food packaging, and also for specialty applications
                including insulation and electronics.

              <p>
                Metallisation is performed using a physical vapour deposition
                process. Aluminium is the most common metal used for deposition,
                but other metals such as nickel or chromium are also used. The
                metal is heated and evaporated under vacuum. This condenses on
                the cold polymer film, which is unwound near the metal vapour
                source. This coating is much thinner than a metal foil could be
                made, in the range of 0.5 micrometres [1]. This coating will not
                fade or discolour over time. While oriented polypropylene and
                PET are the most common films used for metallisation, nylon,
                polyethylene and cast polypropylene are also used.

                Properties:
              </motion.h4>
              <p>
                Metallised films have a reflective silver surface similar to
                aluminium foil. The coating also reduces the permeability of the
                film to light, water, and oxygen. The properties of the film
                remain, such as higher toughness, the ability to be heat sealed,
                and a lower density at a lower cost than aluminium foil. This
                gives metallised films some advantages over aluminium foil and
                aluminium foil laminates.

                Both metallised PET and PP have replaced foil laminates for
                products such as snack foods, coffee, and candy, which do not
                require the superior barrier of aluminium foil. Metallised nylon
                and polyethylene are used in the meat export market. The
                controlled permeation extends shelf life. Metallised films are
                used as a susceptor for cooking in microwave ovens.

              <p>
                Metallised PET films are used in NASA´s spacesuits to make them
                radiation resistant and keep astronauts warm, and in proximity
                (aluminized) suits are used by AR-FF fire fighters for
                protection from the high amount of heat released from fuel
                fires. Silvered emergency blankets are also used to conserve a
                shock victim's body heat. These reflective materials might also
                be used as part of industrial and commercial insulation (for
                example, insulated shipping containers.)insulating blankets made
                with Metallised PET were also used as insulation in aircraft
                untilsafety concerns resulted in their deprecation.[5] In
                particular, it was found to be a major cause of the in–flight
                fire of Swissair Flight 111 on September 2, 1998.
