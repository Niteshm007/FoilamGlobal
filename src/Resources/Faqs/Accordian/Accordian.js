              Approximately 75% of heat transmission is by radiation, most
              material used on buildings absorb radiation heat and re-radiate
              it, which makes the room temperature much higher than outside, and
              has Air-conditioning to work constantly. But aluminium foil
              insulation can reflect 97% radiation heat, so it saves your energy
              bill and provides you comfortable room temperature.

              Just like a space suit, the Radiant Barrier reflects the sun’s
              heat before it can warm up the insulation in your attic. When the
              insulation stays cooler, your house will stay cooler. It helps to
              understand how Radiant Barrier will work for you if you think of
              other things that work in much the same way.

              Besides helping you save money and increase the energy efficiency

              interior comfort levels.

              Reflective Aluminium Foil Insulations don’t absorb heat, they
              block the flow of radiation. Installing Reflective Aluminium Foil
              between the heat source (sun) and an existing insulation will
              improve the effectiveness of the R-Value rated insulation. The
              reason is that only a little part of the heat is now hitting the
              R-Value rated insulation and therefore, it will take longer for it
              to absorb 100% of its potential thereby holding the heat longer
              before passing out the back side into the room. Reflective
              Aluminium Foil reflects up to 97% radiant heat striking its
              surface.

              It is important to maintain at least a 3/4″ air space on the side
              of the radiant barrier you want to reflect heat. So, you can
              prevent introducing any conductive heat flow to the aluminium to
              the aluminium foil facing and improve the efficiency for
              insulation.
